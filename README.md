# Private On-Chain Trading Bot

On-chain trading has the advantage of full transparency favored by DeFi advocates and users, however, transparency sadly kills the competitive advantage a trading algorithm might have over its competition. Privacy, when it comes to on-chain trading, comes in at least two guises: algorithmic privacy _(hiding the code and ideas behind the code)_ and data privacy _(hiding the algorithmâ€™s inputs)_.

This project aims to partition the computation into public and private parts to find the optimal mix of off-chain and on-chain computation to achieve a decentralised partially private algorithm for on-chain trading.

/// @title Pseudocode of an On-Chain Trading Bot Written with zkay Language
/// @author Ceren KocaoÄŸullar

/// This pseudocode bot aims to do the following:
// * Users can subscribe to the bot
// * The bot has an administrator which collects investments in an investment pool, trades and 
//   distributes the resulting money among the subscribed users proportionate to the amounts they have invested
// * This pseudocode assumes that the trading occurs only once and does not go into the details of a periodic approach
// 
/// Limitations of zkay to consider: 
// 1. zkay v2 does not support imports
// 2. zkay v2 does not support private money transactions. 
// 3. zkay v1 does not support some types such as struct, array, float.
//    No information is provided about these types in zkay v2 report or documentation, so I am not sure yet if they are available
//    I have written this pseudocode assuming these types are not supported
//
// Important implications of these limitations are:
// 1. Since zkay does not support imports or private transactions, if we want to make the amount invested by the users private, 
//    we should handle transactions separately with a privacy-preserving protocol, e.g. ZCash
// 2. Also because zkay does not support imports, we cannot directly access oracle prices or do trading on exchanges through this contract.
//    We should use an additional contract, maybe calling this one, or the admin should handle these off-chain. 
//    We should consider this limitation carefully and look at our options in a way that does not put too much trust into admin 
//    and ensures the correctness of the price information, amount of total traded money, gains, and losses.
// 
// What is private?
// * Parameters of the trading algorithms are private
// * The admin can privately choose which trading algorithm to use
// * The amounts invested by the users and the amounts they receive as a result of the trades are private
//
// What are the benefits other than these privacy benefits?
// * Trades are handled by a single admin. Gas costs paid from the investment pool and the profit is distributed from there
// * Users can check if they have received the amount of money they were meant to receive

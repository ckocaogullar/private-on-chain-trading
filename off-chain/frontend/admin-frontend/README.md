# Admin Off-Chain

Consists of a React frontend app and a Node server as a proxy. The server is needed for running shell scripts to generate proofs easily, controlled by the frontend app.

You should give execution permission to the proof generation script as follows:

`chmod u+x createProof.sh`

You can start running both run the React app and Server concurrently.

Download the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn` both in the root folder (admin/frontend) and the client folder.

# Zokrates Decision Proof

The code under this directory allows the untrusted instance to generate a zero-knowledge proof, which proves the legitimacy of the trading algorithm's trading decision.

This code is created using the [Zokrates library and toolkit] (https://zokrates.github.io/introduction.html).

root.zok contains the logic of the proof. All other files under this diretory are auto-generated by Zokrates.

verifier.sol is the auto-generated Solidity file, which should be deployed on the blockchain as the verifier smart contract.

off-chain/host/client.py calls Zokrates commands on this directory to generate proofs to be sent to the verifier smart contract.
